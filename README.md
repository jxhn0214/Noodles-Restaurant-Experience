# Noodles Restaurant Experience

This project emulates the ordering experience at a local restaurant.

---

## Description

This project utilizes an external library called tabulate to beautify the menu display of dishes.
Additionally, it incorporates a module I built that handles the majority of the ordering logic.
I created this project to hone my skills in Python concepts like list comprehensions and f-strings, along with
ordinary programming concepts like lists, dictionaries, loops, error handling, and read/write files.
I was also able to get some experience with Git in this project, using commands like
init, add, commit, push, checkout, log, status, etc.
