## Description

This project utilizes an external library called tabulate to beautify the menu display of dishes.
Additionally it incorporates a module I built that handles the majority of the logic that goes into ordering.
I created this project to hone my skills in python concepts like list comphrehensions and fstrings along with
ordinary programming concepts like lists, dictionaries, loops, error handling, etc.
I was also able to get some experience with Git in this project using commands like
init, add, commit, push, checkout, log, status, etc.
